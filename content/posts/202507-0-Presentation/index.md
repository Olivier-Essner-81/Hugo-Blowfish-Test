Whether you have an idea for a new software project or need a new application to reach a wider customer base, this five-article series will provide you with the key aspects to make your project a success.

## Target audience

This article series aims to be a practical and concise guide for **mid-sized application projects**, typically those for **Small and Medium-sized Enterprises**. While the fundamental principles remain the same, this guide won't cover implementing a large-scale ERP project for a 20,000-employee multinational.

## Prerequisite

**No prior IT knowledge is required**. All useful concepts will be explained as you go, providing you with enough understanding to grasp an application's main technical requirements and then discuss them with developers and IT service providers.

## Structure

I recommend reading the articles in their publication order to understand how all phases of such a project connect:
* The first article, **[Lets Talk Business]({{< ref "posts/202507-1-Lets-Talk-Business.md" >}})** will introduce the fundamental questions for validating your project idea.
* The second article, **[Documenting Your Needs Effectively]({{< ref "posts/202507-2-Documenting-your-business-need.md" >}})** will cover collecting, analysing, and formalizing your business requirements.
* The third article, **[Technical Aspects]({{< ref "posts/202507-3-Technical-aspects.md" >}})** will explore the essential technical points you'll need to include in your specifications.
* The fourth article, **[Buy or Build]({{< ref "posts/202507-4-Make-or-buy.md" >}})** will offer guidance on answering this eternal question in enterprise software.
* Finally, the last article, **[Thinking About the Future]({{< ref "posts/202507-5-Thinking-about-the-future.md" >}})** will conclude with the long-term management of your application.

A **[glossary]({{< ref "posts/202507-6-Glossary.md" >}})** will help for new terms you can be not familiar with.
