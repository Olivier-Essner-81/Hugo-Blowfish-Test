Let's first take a step back and look at the broader development of your application (website, web application, mobile application, etc.):
* What's its **market**?
* What **direct or indirect gains** do you expect from it?
* How **important** is this application to your business?
* Who in your company can be **responsible for overseeing this project**?
Beyond confirming the real business opportunity for your application project, these questions will help you determine a maximum timeline and budget allocation.

## Value Proposition
The value proposition will be the economic reason for your future application's existence. It will unambiguously explain what makes your application unique and why it will be a real asset for your customers or for internal use within your company.
In other words, it's about defining the problem(s) your solution will solve. For example: time savings leading to financial gains, reduced operating costs, or a new user experience that brings in additional customers.
A strong value proposition drives the decision to start your application project. Conversely, difficulty in finding a good value proposition might signal that you're heading in the wrong direction, and a new application won't be a wise investment.

## Market research
Once the value proposition is defined, a quick **market study** will help you understand or confirm the environment in which your application will operate. This includes, for example, identifying a target audience with unmet needs and assessing the potential size of that market.
Also, analyze your **competitors**: If all your competitors are using the same application, you should dig deep to understand why. It might not be a coincidence, but rather a sign that it's the most rational choice for you.

## Persona
**Personas** are concise, fictional representations of your key users, based on real data and assumptions about their behaviours, needs, and motivations. It's more of an intellectual exercise than a science, but it extends previous business analyses.
Don't confuse the number of people with their importance: Even a small group of strategic users can justify creating a detailed persona. A persona helps you design an application that precisely meets the expectations of its future users. It will help you better address their real needs.

## SWOT analysis
This strategic methodology will help you identify your project's **internal strengths** (e.g., strong domain expertise among your employees) and **weaknesses** (like a lack of budget compared to too broad a scope for the application).
Also, list **external opportunities** (perhaps a new market your application will give you access to) and **threats** (typically an already well-established competitor)

## Internal accountable person
Appointing an **internal project lead** is essential for successful execution. This person will be the central point, responsible for coordinating internal and/or external teams, tracking progress, and making key decisions.
Depending on the application's scope and urgency, this person's workload could range from a few hours per week to a full-time commitment over several months.

## Short- and long-term vision
Beyond the first version, have a **future "vision"** for your application, both short-term and long-term:
* **Short-term**: What are the immediate objectives and minimum viable functionalities to make your application viable?
* **Long-term**: How will your application evolve to adapt to market changes and user needs?
You can refer to the article "**Thinking About the Future**" for more details on this point.

## My experience
In my opinion, whether your application is for internal company use or intended for your customers, the process of **verifying the real need** should remain the same.
Software development has this "magic" about it: anything you could ever need is achievable; it's all a matter of budget. It's up to you to ensure that the requested price will be recouped by your company. This implies staying **"reasonable" about the project's scope and complexity**, and, upstream, having **clearly defined your needs** to get realistic quotes from service providers or vendors. I'll elaborate on this point in the next article, "**Documenting Your Needs Effectively**".
